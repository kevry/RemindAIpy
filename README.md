# RemindAIpy (python)
Python alternative to the Remind A.I. project

#### Written by Kevin M. Delgado

## Objective (updated)
Since COVID-19 many institutions and businesses have transitied their staff to a remote setting. However, as a result of this, students and workers are now required to be in front of a computer almost all the time. Unfortunately, having to sit for so long can lead to many physical health issues. Sources such as the National Health Service of UK, and PainScience, have recommended a maximum of 30 minutes of sitting at one go. However, this number is always exceeded. To solve this issue, I decided to develop a web gui that utilizes deep learning to track if users are sitting or standing. If the application detects that the user has been sitting for more than the recommended time, an alarm or notification will be activated to notify the user to stand. For reinforcement, this alert will continually be activated until the app detects the user has stood up. The overall goal of this is to prevent users from sitting for prolonged periods of time.
